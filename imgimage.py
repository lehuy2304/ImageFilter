The main class for our imager application.

class Image(object):
    """
    A class that allows flexible access to an image Pixel list.
    
    One of the things that we will see in this assignment is that sometimes you want to
    treat an image as a flat 1D list and other times you want to treat is as a 2D list.
    This class has methods that allow you to go back and forth between the two.
    
    If you want to treat the image like a 2D list, you use the methods `getPixel` and 
    `setPixel`.  As with the Pixels class, pixels are represented as 3-element tuples,
    with each element in the range 0..255.  For example, red is (255,0,0).  These methods
    are used by all of the Instagram-style filter functions.
    
    If you want to treat the image like a 1D list you use the methods `getFlatPixel` and
    `setFlatPixel`.  These methods are used by the steganography methods.
    
    IMMUTABLE ATTRIBUTES (Fixed after initialization)
        _pixels: The underlying list of pixels      [Pixel object]
        _length: The number of pixels in the list   [int >= 0]
    
    MUTABLE ATTRIBUTES (Can be changed at any time)
        _width:  The image width, which is the number of columns [int > 0]
        _height: The image height, which is the number of rows   [int > 0]
    There is an additional invariant that width*height == length at all times.  So
    if you change width, you must change height.
